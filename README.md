# RoverPy App
> Taking Agriculture to a whole new level!

This is an application interface for the [RoverPy Project](https://github.com/RoverPy/RoverPy), which allows the farmers to see whatever is going on their RoverPy on the app. 

The job of the app is to process the images captured by the RoverPy using a Tensorflow Lite Model deployed on Firebase Custom Model, while at the same time control the RoverPy from the Controls Page and see a live-feed on the app. Wait that's not it, our app provides an interface to see all the past records of the RoverPy's round and depending on the confidence level (of it's health) a bar-chart is built in realtime to give a graphical representation of all the past records! Moreover, to actually visualize where the plant was detected we have provided marker's (either healthy / unhealthy) on Google Map using the co-ordinates gathered by the RoverPy.

## Key Features
- [x] Our custom Tensorflow Lite Model is being used on our App
- [x] Our own Dataset gathered from a live farm
- [x] Multiple Tensorflow Models for various plants & flowers to detect a wide array of diseases
- [x] Live feed directly from the RoverPy to our app
- [x] Controlling the RoverPy from our App
- [x] An in-depth stastical insight for the past records
- [x] Use of dynamic graphs based on the confidence level
- [x] A minimalistic yet sexy UI :wink:
